# SFPC Fall 2017


The Fall program will focus on four tracks.

1. Code (taught by Zach Lieberman with TA Robby Kraft)

2. Critical theory (taught by Morehshin Allahyari, TA Melanie Hoff)

3. Hardware (taught by Taeyoon Choi and Pam Liou with TA Max Fowler) 

4. Code Poetry (taught by Ramsey Nasser, Sam Lavigne and Nick Montfort). 

We’re excited to have Golan Levin join us as SFPC’s artist in residence and this session will be organized by Taeyoon, Zach and Lauren Gardner.

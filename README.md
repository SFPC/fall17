The Fall program will focus on four tracks.

1. Code ([Recreating the Past](https://github.com/ofZach/recreatingThePast_fall17) taught by Zach Lieberman with TA Robby Kraft)

2. Critical theory ([The Radical Outside](https://github.com/morehshin/TheRadicalOutside) taught by Morehshin Allahyari, TA Melanie Hoff)

3. Hardware ([Handmaking Computer](https://github.com/tchoi8/HandmakingComputer) taught by Taeyoon Choi and Pam Liou with TA Max Fowler) 

4. Code Poetry (taught by [Ramsey Nasser](https://github.com/nasser/rdclcmps), Sam Lavigne and Nick Montfort with TA Todd Anderson).
